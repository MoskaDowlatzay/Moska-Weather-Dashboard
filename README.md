# Moska-Weather-Dashboard

# Introduction:
Welcome to Moska Weather Dashboard it is a convenient weather app using OpenWeather's free API to display five day forecast when a city is entered in the search bar. User searches by city name and the corresponding weather will appear with city name, date, temperature, humidity and wind speed.

# Design:
I chose to use a cloudy background for my page and I used matching colours for the header and the cards.
